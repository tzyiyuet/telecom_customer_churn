# Data Analysis on Telecommunication Company
Considering the competitiveness and the saturation of the telecommunication industry, we would like to establish a customer-centric strategy based on insights to reduce the churning rate of the telecommunication company. In order to do that, we built a logistic model and applied data visualization on analyzing the relationships between independent variables and the dependent variable. The insights revealed the demographic variables, account information, type of services that drive to a high churn rate.

The strategy will focus on incentivizing customers to switch payment methods with automated transit for both new and existing customers. The recommendation suggests that sending promotional campaigns to attract senior citizens and singles. Finally, in terms of product offerings, it is recommended to improve the qualities of services by ensuring connections, training employees more frequently and offering multiple tires of products, meanwhile, conducting surveys of the existing customers to gather data on their preferences that can be used for other types of analysis such as conjoint analysis.
