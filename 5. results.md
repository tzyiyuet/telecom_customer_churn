# 5. Results (in progress)
## I. The Model
As we noticed from the heatmap, there are multicollinearity conditions happening between some independent variables. The correlation between those independent variables is equal to one, which means that the two variables are highly correlated and will lead to the issue of collinearity. Therefore, we tried to remove these variables from our model (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, online security_no internet service; online backup_no internet service; device protection_no internet service; techsupport_no internet service; streaming TV_no internet service and streamingMovie_no internet service), and we got a score about **0.752**.

Thus, the final model is:

## II. Analysis
Base on the model that is presented above, a few results can be drawn, respectively. 
First, by examining the coefficients of the demographical category variables, they are all in negative signs, meaning all things being equal, being one of these variables decreases the chance to churn. However, in contrast, the negative signs of the variables **Dependents** and **Partner** also indicate that if the customers do not have dependents or partners, they will be more likely to churn.

Second, there are three variables in the account information category require to be highlighted: **Contract_Month-to-month**, **PaymentMethod_Electronic check** and **PaperlessBilling**. The coefficient of **Contract_Month-to-month** is the largest among all the variables. We can conclude that all else being equal, people with month-to-month contracts were more likely to have churned than other contracts. Conversely, customers with one or two-year contracts were less likely to have switched, as shown by their negative signs of coefficients. In terms of payment methods, the model demonstrates that people with electronic check payment methods were more likely to switch while others have higher loyalty. Furthermore, the automatic payment methods (bank transfers and credit cards) are more effective methods to decrease churn probability. **PaperlessBilling** is also a significant variable that leads to churn.

Lastly, the Internet service of fiber optic is the primary variable for churning. Notably, without having other secondary internet services (online security, online backup, device protection, and tech support), customers have a higher chance of churning, indicating the reliable quality of these services. Nonetheless, customers with the services of **StreamingTV** and **StreamingMovies** have a higher chance to churn, which indicate by their positive sign.
