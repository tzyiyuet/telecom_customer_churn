# 5. Results (in progress)
## a. The Model
As we noticed from the heatmap, there are multicollinearity conditions happening between some independent variables. The correlation between those independent variables is equal to one, which means that the two variables are highly correlated. Therefore, we tried to remove these variables from our model (online security_no internet service; online backup_no internet service; device protection_no internet service; techsupport_no internet service; streaming TV_no internet service and streamingMovie_no internet service), and we got a score about 0.766，which is a little lower compared to the model with all variables in (0.769).

Thus, we finally choose the model, including all the variables, to get a more precise result. Our final model is:



## b. Coefficients
### I. Demongraphic 
In terms of the coefficient of the demographic variables, the result for Senior Citizen is approx.0.26, having a positive coefficient. It can be said that, with all else being equal, clients who are in the senior age group are more likely to have churned than non-senior citizens. Meanwhile, the variables Partner and Dependents having a negative coefficient, -0.035 and -0.13, suggests that with all else being equal, as the clients have Partner and Dependents, the clients are less likely to have churned. The coefficients for gender_female and gender_male are both quite small, and since they also have a small correlation, their effect on churn can thereby be neglected. In terms of the magnitude of the coefficients, Senior Citizen is approximately two times larger than Dependents and ten times larger than Partner, which means the effect of being senior or non-senior leading to churn is twice as big as having dependents and ten times larger than having partners.

### II. Account Information 
The coefficient of the contract month-to-month is about 0.73, the largest one among all the variables. As it is a positive number, we conclude that all else being equal, people with month-to-month contracts were more likely to have churned than other contracts.  Customers with one or two-year contracts were less likely to have switched, as shown by their negative signs of coefficients.

In the case of the electronic check payment, the estimated coefficient is approximately 0.26, while the other three methods payments have negative coefficients. Thus, we can say that people with electronic check payment methods were more likely to switch while others have higher loyalty, as shown by their opposite signs. In addition, the magnitude of bank transfer (-0.073) and credit card (-0.036) payment method is quite small compared with the other two methods. As a result, using automated payment methods (bank transfers and credit cards) is less effective than using a mail-order payment method in leading not to churn.

As for the paperless billing, the coefficient is approximately 0.39, which means that people with paperless billings were more likely to have changed, and the effect of leading customers to churn is significant compared to other variables. What’s more, the effect of having paperless billing is a little more than twice as big in terms of leading to churn, as is the effect of no tech-support (0.19). 

### III. Services
The coefficient of the phone services is -0.27749, indicating the customer with phone service will be less likely to churn by 27.75%, meaning that customers feel positive for the phone services.  However, without the multiple lines service, customers will also be less likely to churn by 24.66%, compared to those with the multiple lines service that customers will only be less likely to churn by 3.09%.

The coefficient of not having internet services is -0.05789, meaning customers who do have any internet services will lower the chance to churn by 5.79%. Specifically, customers with fiber optic (24.05%) have a higher chance to churn than those with DSL(21.71%), indicating a dissatisfied quality of fiber optic but a satisfying quality of DSL.

For secondary internet services, the results are quite distinct. First, customers with online security decrease the chance to churn by 23.53% and those without online security increase the opportunity to churn by 25.87%. Hence, online security is a critical service to lower the churn in terms of the magnitude of the coefficient. Tech support is also a service of high quality as customers will be more likely to churn without tech support by 19.26%, but be less likely to churn with tech support by 16.91%. In addition,  having online backup or device protection receive positive feedback from customers with relatively lower coefficients of  -0.06282 and -0.1922 than not having these services, which increases the chance to churn by 8.63% and 4.27%. In contrast, streaming movies and streaming TV have opposite feedback as secondary services. Notably, customers who have streaming movies have 15.40% more to churn, while customers who do not have streaming movies have 13.06 less to churn. On the contrary, the chance to churn increases by 7.77% if customers have streaming tv. But if customers do not have streaming tv, the opportunity to churn decreases by 5.43%. In other words, streaming tv and streaming movies are mainly the services that the company needs to focus on improvement.
