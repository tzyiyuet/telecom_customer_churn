## a. The Model
As we noticed from the heatmap, there are multicollinearity conditions happening between some independent variables. The correlation between those independent variables is equal to one, which means that the two variables are highly correlated and will lead to the issue of collinearity. Therefore, we tried to remove these variables from our model (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, online security_no internet service; online backup_no internet service; device protection_no internet service; techsupport_no internet service; streaming TV_no internet service and streamingMovie_no internet service), and we got a score about 0.752.

Thus, the final model is:
