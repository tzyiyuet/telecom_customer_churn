# 2. The Problem Statement & The Project Objective
The telecommunication industry is expecting considerable revenue growth in the future, with an increase of 3.3% in 2020 (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070815/what-telecommunications-sector.asp). It is becoming increasingly saturated, and companies can barely rely on acquiring new subscribers to sustain profitability. Accordingly, given the competitiveness of the industry environment, finding and analyzing the factors which affect customer churn is quite essential for a telecom company to maintain its financial health and to improve services. The objective of this project would be to leverage a customer-centric strategy by deep diving into our dataset to get a comprehensive understanding and critical insights that could explain the customer churn data of a provided company. In order to do so, we have applied data visualizations and built up models to study the correlation between the independent variables and dependent variables.
