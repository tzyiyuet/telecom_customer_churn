# 1. Model Selection
To investigate the customer churn in the telecommunication industry, our group chose the logistic regression to build the model. The dependent variable of the logistic model is binary data, as the result of customer churn can only be yes (1) or no (0). The correlation between variables and their coefficients can be determined by the logistic model. Therefore, telecommunication can improve their specific service by referring to variables with high regression coefficients and high correlation coefficients. Moreover, customer churn can be predicted, and telecommunication companies have the opportunity to save their customers before they churn by applying this model.
