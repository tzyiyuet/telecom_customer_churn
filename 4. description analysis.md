## 4. Description Analysis
# a. Demographic Variables Analysis
The variables which describe clients’ demographic features are gender, dependent, partner and senior. The gender variable contains two values: male and female. This dataset is composed of 50.29%  male and 49.71% of females. However, it can be seen from the histogram comparing gender and churn that, the distributions are quite even and thereby there is not very insightful to drive any kind of business decisions and strategy towards gender since our services are gender neutral we don’t see any disproportionality in terms of gender representation. 

In terms of the binary variable dependent, it represents if the client has any children. We also observe that our dataset contains more clients who do not have children than those who have. More importantly, we know that if the client doesn’t have any children, there’s a high proportion of them that will churn. Meanwhile, in terms of the another binary variable Partner, the data also show that within the group of clients who do not have a partner, a large portion of them churn. Combining these two variables dependent and partner, it can be concluded that the clients who churn are likely to be single (does not have children or partner). 

The other binary variable senior indicates if the clients are equal to or above 65 years old. From our updated dataset, 80.95% of the client base is non-senior and only 19.05% of the clients are senior, which conforms to the fact that the majority population of our customer base is non-senior. In addition, within the senior group, most of them will churn. Accordingly, our business strategy should be designed to target non-senior customers. 

Correlation:
* Senior : 0.1604
* Gender female: 0.0054; male: -0.0054
* Partner: -0.1734
* Dependent: -0.1984

The correlation results have demonstrated the strength and direction of a relationship between the demographic variables and our dependent variable. It appears that the variables both gender female and gender male have very low correlation with the dependent variable. In other words, it further proves that our service is gender neutral, strategies targeting gender will be inefficient. The two negative correlations are Partner and Dependent, it can be seen that the relationships are not strong but negative, having a partner or dependent will slightly increase the churn rate. In other words, clients who are single are slightly less likely to churn.
