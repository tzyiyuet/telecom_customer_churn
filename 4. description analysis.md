# 4. Description Analysis
## a. Analysis of Demographic Variables 
The variables which describe clients’ demographic features are **gender**, **dependent**, **partner** and **senior**. The **gender** variable contains two values: male and female. This dataset is composed of 50.29%  male and 49.71% of females. Accoring to Figure 1, the distributions are quite even and thereby there is not very insightful to drive any kind of business decisions and strategy towards gender since our services are gender neutral.

Figure 1. Distribution of Gender

In terms of the binary variable **dependent**, which represents if the client has any children. We also observe that our dataset contains more clients who do not have children than those who have. More importantly, we know that if the client doesn’t have any children, there’s a high proportion of them that will churn. Meanwhile, in terms of the another binary variable **partner**, the data also show that within the group of clients who do not have a partner, a large portion of them churn. Combining these two variables **dependent** and **partner**, we conclude that the clients who churn are likely to be single (does not have children or partner). 

The other binary variable **senior** indicates if the clients are or older than 65 years old. From our updated dataset, 80.95% of the client base is non-senior and only 19.05% of the clients are senior, which conforms to the fact that the majority population of our customer base is non-senior. In addition, within the senior group, most of them will churn. Accordingly, our business strategy should be designed to target non-senior customers.

Figure 2. Correlations between the Independent Variables and the Dependent Variable

Correlations of Demographic Variables:
* Senior: 0.1604
* Gender female: 0.0054; male: -0.0054
* Partner:-0.1734
* Dependent: -0.1984

Through Figure 2, the variables both **gender** female and gender male have very low correlation with the dependent variable. In other words, it further proves that our service is gender neutral. Consequently, strategies that targets the aspect of gender will be inaffective. The two negative correlations are **Partner** and **Dependent**. The values of the relationships are not strong but negative, which indicate that having a partner or dependent will slightly increase the churn rate. In other words, clients who are single are slightly less likely to churn.

## b. Analysis of Account Information Variables
This section included three variables: **contract type**, **payment method**, **paperless billing** With regards to the variable **contract type**, there are three contract types: month-to-month contract (66.10%); one-year based contract (17.28%) and two-year based (16.61%). Most customers prefer a short-term contract, which confirms the current purchasing habits. Consumers today adopt new things quickly and would easily change their mind. Therefore, the churn rate with month-to-month contracts is the highest among these three types. Besides, the preference between one-year and two-year contracts is almost the same. Throughout a two-year contract, the churn rate is much lower, meaning that the higher the customer's satisfaction with the service, the higher the customer's loyalty to the company.

As for the payment method, there are four methods provided to the customers: bank transfer (automatic), credit card (automatic), electronic check and mailed check. Most customers would like to pay using electronic check (41.39%). However, we found that the electronic check has, by far, the largest churn rate compared to other methods. Preference among the other three payment methods is almost the same, around 20% each, and their churn rates are also similar. 

What's more, **paperless billing** contributes to a large proportion (63.64%) of the cluster, which confirms that people today prefer to use electronic devices such as mobile phones for transactions, and paperless billing is more recommended from the point of view of environmental protection. 

Correlations of Account Information Variables:
* Contract month-to-month: 0.4832
* Contract one-year: -0.2205
* Contract two-year: -0.3877
* Payment mailed check: -0.1110
* Payment electronic check: 0.3255.
* Payment bank transfer: --0.1426
* Payment credit card: -0.1516
* Paperless billing: 0.2279

Based on Figure 2, the correlation of the contract month-to-month is 0.4832, the highest one among all the independent variables. Furthermore, the large absolute value of month-to-month (0.4832) and two-year (0.3877) contracts also told us that contract types play a significant role in determining whether customers churned or not. As for the payment method, people with electronic check payment methods were more likely to switch while others have higher loyalty, as shown by their opposite signs.

## c. Analysis of Services Variables
One of the main categories that we analyzed is the type of service provided. In fact, the two primary services are **phone service** and **internet service**. We noticed that around 90% of the customers use the phone service.  The percentage of customers who use **multiple lines** services, which is under the phone service as a secondary service, is almost 50% of the customers who have the phone service (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Distribution of multiple lines service (pie chart)

For the **internet service**, there are two types of internet service provided for customers, which are **DSL** and **Fiber optic**. In general, more customers choose **fiber optic** (52.27%) than **DSL** (31.49%). Especially, on the one hand, more customers with internet services will have the services of **streaming TV** and **streaming movies** (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Distribution of secondary internet services

On the other hand, tech support is the least popular service (Figure 4). In order to further understand the differences between **DSL** and **fiber optic**, we examined the distribution of secondary Internet services for each one. We noticed that for **DSL** internet service, the distribution of the secondary services is quite similar (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Distribution of DSL secondary internet services 

However, the distribution of secondary services of fiber optic internet service is quite distinct, with most customers having the streaming TV and streaming movies, and a rather low amount of customers having online security and tech support services (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Distribution of fiber optic secondary internet services 

Correlations of Services Variables:
* Online security: No: 0.388; Yes: -0.206
* Tech support: No: 0.3874; Yes: -0.2044
* Internet - Fiber optic: 0.3428
* Online backup: No: 0.2949; Yes: -0.0971
* Device protection: No: 0.2698; Yes: -0.0703
* Streaming TV: No: 0.1294; Yes: 0.0771
* Streaming movies: No: 0.162; Yes: 0.0445
* Multiples Lines : No: -0.037; Yes: 0.0399
* Internet Service_DSL: - 0.1465
* Internet service_No: - 0.2945

Again, according to Figure 2, the highlighted correlations above demonstrate that the qualities of internet services of fiber optic are dissatisfied. Specifically, the customer will be less likely to churn without having a number of internet services.
