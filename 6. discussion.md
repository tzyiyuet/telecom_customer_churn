Our strategy will focus on a customer-centric approach by leveraging customer insight and personalization. One proposed improvement of their business model is related to the customer base. The company can attract more singles (have neither partner nor dependents) by sending out exclusive promotional campaigns on Valentine's Day. Singles account for a large portion of the population who have a very high purchasing power. We can collaborate with certain dating platforms/apps to present the special Valentine's promotion that targets the singles.

Second, customer trust and loyalty are essential for building a successful business. While this may sound obvious, it is hard to overstate the value of establishing a solid base of long-term customers. As contract types play a significant role in determining whether customers churned or not, we encourage the company to give some promotion to ensure that new/ prospective customers choose one or two-year contracts. Besides, being able to forecast guaranteed revenue years down the road can help companies map out the progress of the business and predict where they will be going forward. What's more, we quickly understand that some payment methods are only less efficient and profitable than others in the long term. The two check payment methods (electronic and mailed checks) offer the highest percentage of churn across all types of contracts (all variables aside). This could be explained by the fact that those two payment methods are less convenient than the bank transfer and credit card options. In fact, the check options do not offer automatic payments, which is an essential aspect of the business model of a telecommunication company. One way to address this issue could be to ensure that new/prospective customers choose automatic renewable payment methods while compelling the existing customers who still use checks as their payment method to switch to automatic renewable payment methods (either bank transfer or credit card). Such a strategy could be easily done by establishing an effective marketing campaign showcasing the convenience of using credit cards and removing the commotion of filling a check every month.

Finally, we noticed that the company could decrease its churn rate by improving its quality of services, especially for fiber optic Internet service, streaming TV and streaming movies. Given that more than 50% of the customers choose fiber optic as their internet service, its churn rate is significantly high. Moreover, for those who choose fiber optic, they also tend to simultaneously purchase the services of streaming TV and streaming movies. We understand that these two service lines are inherently competitive, and their very nature is based on personal taste (subjectivity). In that sense, customers might be more inclined to churn if the company does not provide state-of-the-art service and up-to-date features regarding their streaming options. The result of the model further indicates that the area of internet service needs to be targeted and improved to satisfy the customers' expectations. We suggest the company focus on improving the quality of the internet connection; meanwhile, providing customers with a broader selection of TV and movie options and offering packages that follow the trends and preferences of the public. This could easily be done with market research by surveying the customers on their preferences and feedback, allowing us to understand customer needs and preferences better. Moreover, this new data analysis would also allow the company to conduct a conjoint analysis in the future.
