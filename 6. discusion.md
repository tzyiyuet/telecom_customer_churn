Our strategy will focus on a customer-centric approach by leveraging customer insight and personalization. One proposed improvement of their business model is related to the customer base. As analyzed previously, Senior clients only account for a small portion of our original customer base and have a relatively high possibility to have churned. Accordingly, Senior customers could be the potential customers we could attract for future development. In order to do so, we can send out promotional campaigns, especially for senior citizens, and to develop a customer division specially targeted at senior citizens. The employees for this division need to be patient and have expertise in communicating with our senior citizens. In addition, another improvement which can enable us to attract more singles will be to send out exclusive promotional campaigns on Valentine's Day. Singles account for a large portion of the population who have a very high purchasing power. We can collaborate with certain dating platforms/apps to present the special Valentine's promotion that targets the singles.  

Second, customer trust and loyalty are essential for building a successful business. Furthermore, while this may sound obvious, it is hard to overstate the value of establishing a solid base of long-term customers. As contract types play a significant role in determining whether customers churned or not, we do encourage the company to give some promotion to ensure that new/ prospective customers choose one or two-year contracts. In addition, being able to forecast guaranteed revenue years down the road can help companies map out the progress of the business and predict where they will be going forward.
What's more, we quickly understand that some payment methods are only less efficient and profitable than others in the long term. The two check payment methods (electronic and mailed checks) offer the highest percentage of churn across all types of contracts (all variables aside). This could be explained by the fact that those two methods of payments are less convenient than the bank transfer and credit card options. In fact, the check options do not offer automatic payments, which is an essential aspect of the business model of a telecommunication company. One way to address this issue could be to ensure that new/prospective customers choose automatic renewable payment methods while compelling the existing customers who still use checks as their payment method to switch to automatic renewable payment methods (either bank transfer or credit card). Such a strategy could be easily done by establishing an effective marketing campaign showcasing the convenience of using credit cards and removing the commotion of filling a check every month. 

Finally, we noticed that the company could decrease its churn rate by improving its quality of services, especially for multiple line service, fibre optic service, tech support, online security, streaming TV and streaming movies. As the multiple line service mainly targets organizations and families, the company needs to not only ensure the stability of the connection, and also provide more effective packages for those groups. The effectiveness can be based on the price and the number of lines with stable connections. In terms of tech support, we propose the company improve its quality by being more responsive and more professional on remote support, which can be achieved by more training on employees. In regards to online security, offer different tiers of security packages for clients according to their needs. For other internet services, we see that though more than 50% of the customers choose fiber optic, its churn rate is significantly high. Moreover, for those who choose fiber optic, they also tend to purchase the services of streaming TV and streaming movies. We must understand that these two lines of service are inherently competitive, and their very nature is based on personal taste (subjectivity). In that sense, customers might be more inclined to churn if the company does not provide state-of-the-art service and up-to-date features in regards to their streaming options. The result of the model further indicates that the area of internet service needs to be targeted and improved in order to satisfy the expectations of the customers. We suggest the company to focus on improving the quality of the internet connection, meanwhile, providing customers with a broader selection of TV and movie options as well as offering packages that follow the trends and preferences of the public. This could easily be done with market research more specifically by surveying our customers on their preferences and feedback, allowing us to gain a better understanding of customer needs and preferences. Moreover, this new data analysis would also allow the company to conduct a conjoint analysis in the future.
